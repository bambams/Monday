<p>Rough draft for plot to Monday:</p>

<p>Opening scene: scrolling shots of either a few tilemapped areas or some cinema graphics. A few opening credits roll over this. The scene is the shuttle carrying our "hero" Monday (working last name) as he/she/they touch down on the landing pad outside base (that's the big square flat area in the south on my map). As the player steps out, they're greeted by whoever, and get led on a tour of a small portion of the base. Rough parallel: the opening to FFVI, the shots of Narshe as the prologue text rolls.</p>

<p>This tour represents the intro to the gameplay and mechanics and serves as a bridge to the first dungeon. It basically juggles some scripted conversations and some free movement around rooms as the setting and mood get established. Some mechanics will get mentioned in passing for plot's sake; example: when you picked up your gun, the tour guide will mention it's a keyed weapon; only you can use it. Later on, you'll find a weapon upgrade in an older model ("Hey, this was from back before they started keying arms. I should take this") which explains why you couldn't take any of the other hundred guns off weapon racks and such. I need to work on fine-tuning all the dialogue for proper foreshadowing and make-sense. This whole intro to the game will take maybe five minutes of real time, give or take.</p>

<p>The starting gun will be a simple ion pistol; it will probably need to cool down after several seconds of rapid fire shooting (a meter for "ammo" will be on the left) and may also have a charge function (hold fire to charge, release to shoot).</p>

<p>The player will talk a little green about the colony, but he knows how to do maintenance and such; it's his cover and he's trained. After he turns in for the night, following a mildly suspicious comment he makes in jest before heading to his quarters, the game begins proper. In the middle of when he's supposed to be sleeping, the tone takes a sharp right turn as he heads off for Dungeon 1 in a way that makes the player curious what's going on ...</p>

<p>As far as Dungeon 1 goes, it'll be some sort of reactor that was a primary cause of the disaster that nuked the city. As we've said, it'll have the trappings of a lot of Zelda games; you'll access a map at some terminal, and there will be switches for doors, possibly times ones. This is something the programmers will need to take into consideration; the player will trigger map changes by walking over some tiles, and they will also need to be able to access terminals by walking up to them and hitting Ctrl or whatever. 3 card keys will be found in the course of the dungeon, opening the way to the final boss, some sort of haywire mech I imagine. The item in here ... I'm still working on that but I'm thinking jetback for traversing holes, either in this dungeon or a later one. No, the player can't jump.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the first dungeon after killing the final boss, there's a flashback to Monday's assignment to this job. The scene is much like the usual dialogue between James Bond and M. This will fully establish the main character's status quo in the player's eyes, so now the player knows why Monday just snuck off to do a dungeon during nap time. Basically it's as we said before; this organization is worried about the possibility of an inside job, partially reflected by records of certain "mishaps" or erratic behavior reported by superiors. I'm still working on that bit, but the main thing is that it has to be something that they're seeing crop up again in the newer, smaller colony, but faster. Off goes Monday to see what the connection is.</p>

<p>The player's main goal in here is investigating the full extent of damage but more importantly, how it happened. Partly by way of confirmation and partly by discovery (Monday is looking for things the original investigative team wasn't, because no one suspected sabotage) Monday determines that it was definitely an inside job, performed across all reactors,  but the problem is not just the scale and coordination, or how they were infiltrated, but the fact that ... they weren't. Since Monday has access through the organization that sent him to background information and personnel files, we know that the people "on the job" had no previous connections, no prior records in general, were not relatively new hires, and could not have just gone nuts from the shock of space habitat. From the evidence, these people seemed to have just decided one day they were all going to turn off the safeties and push A Very Bad Button, and did so pretty much at the same time, killing themselves in the process. As we'll learn later, the people were corrupted by the aliens nearby and it was far from sudden; control of the minds of intelligent species on this level takes time to establish. Nonetheless, the aliens were successful in causing most of the city to explode. We'll meet them later.</p>

<p>For now, the player has answers to the main character's past, but more questions than answers regarding the disaster, and just enough information to determine there's probably a logical explanation, but nowhere near enough to determine what it is. Day two (nap time is over now) begins with Monday officially taking over as a Specialist Engineer, and the first task set before you is determining the state of the broken vehicle west of base and fixing it. This will require some footwork in and out of base and will be a bit of a puzzle for the player to figure out. Random chats with colony personnel will help establish setting and plot up to this point.</p>

<p>Once the vehicle is fixed, but before it can be driven back to base, Monday notices the newly fixed equipment on board is picking up something funny further west. Was this science vehicle sabotaged to prevent discovery of something? New item off the car's tool rack: rock crusher! Can disintegrate certain forms of mineral. You'll use it to open new "doors" in Dungeon Number Two: the mine! This is a setting closely linked with the city, as geological research on new planets was part of their work. The "three keys" system in here will work as settings on the rock crusher gun; three newly discovered frequencies or settings will allow the destruction of three distinct mineral types, which are (in)conveniently acting as barriers to new rooms. These frequencies will be acquired by finding the research stations within the mines and either extracting data gained about the minerals, or directly scanning concentrated purified minerals extracted from ore. Grats; now you can smash holes in rocks that contain these minerals.</p>

<p>I haven't decided what tricks or item this dungeon has yet; this is still plot. But basically, they discovered a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>They found the ruins of an alien city. The graphics for Dungeon 2 are mainy rock, but you'll enter the odd cleared alien dwelling, dirty as it is.</li>
<li>This thing is well under a mountain. The aliens were subterranean by nature.</li>
<li>Scans of similar materials show another ruins might be nearby (yes, Dungeon 3).</li>
</ol>

<p>Boss will be some sort of giant alien worm or something. It will be partly mineral itself and the player will need the rock smasher and whatever the Dungeon 2 Item is to kill it. Question on controls; what would be the button layout to control movement with keyboard, aiming with mouse, and 2+ items? Probably map both items to mouse buttons, gun is one of them unless unequipped of course. <span class="mono">Ctrl</span> or <span class="mono">Space</span> to interact with objects?</p>

<p>I haven't totally finished plotting the bridge from Dungeon 2 to 3, but Monday knows enough now that an "inside job" is happening here too. The breakdown of that research vehicle was too convenient; it blocked the route to the mines so no other serious equipment could get passed. The player has met most if not all of the personnel at the colony so this is turning into a "whodunit" as names start being checked off the list. Still a big list right now though, and there can be more than one culprit (hint: there is). This will also be the time that Monday finds some "information" left in his room. Someone knows who he is and what he's doing and who might be behind this. This is another detail I'm fleshing out but ultimately the player finds the "new ruins" and goes looking for more info. Someone didn't want us to know about this thing to the east of base ... underground again of course.</p>

<p>This city is much newer. There are glowing crystals and signs of power (dungeon 1 was lit by emergency backup lights from previous crews, the mines were using the lights that were brought there by miners. This place is actually still being lit, presumably by the former occupants). I'm still planning this one, but here's a chance to grab some alien tech, maybe use three gems to power different coloured teleporters.</p>

<p>This will be a bit of a short dungeon but there will be enough clues for Monday to figure out after the fact what's going on: Dungeon 3 wasn't alien ruins, it was an actual alien city! Why you don't see aliens are up to imagination; maybe the aliens were the crystals, maybe they're only partially corporeal. Doesn't matter. They didn't want to be discovered, the city was actively attacked ... it doesn't take much of a leap to figure out the aliens were behind the original incident. Psychic influence is all that makes sense, but there's not much time to get much past the hypothesis on that theory; the new saboteurs are making their move.</p>

<p>In the final act, the informant is revealed, and the alien's new plan comes to light; we kill your city and you come back, eh? Fine. We'll send our puppets to your local primary command ship and blow that to kingdom come instead, see how soon you come back then. Final Dungeon, here we come. A team of humans on the alien's side now, all of whom have varying degrees of authority and access, have compromised the ship and are in the process of getting a jerry-built self destruction going. The theme here will be much different; it's less key cards and more action and fighting. You'll be fighting compromised military hardware and drone troops that just do what they're programmed to, though creative use of your acquired equipment will still be essential to success. Arrive at the command ship well after the puppet crew, rescue stranded survivors, stop the traitors, save the day.</p>

<p>The End</p>
