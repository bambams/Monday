#  Each Map contains several Levels (floors), and each Level can (should)     #
#  contain Triggers.                                                          #

#  Triggers contain several bits of information apiece, so they must be       #
#  defined in this file, separate from the Map or Layer config files.         #
#  Triggers contain:                                                          #
#    - a unique ID                                                            #
#    - coordinates (x, y)                                                     #
#    - a "type" value which indicates what kind of a marker it is:            #
#      - activate when stepped ON                                             #
#      - activate when stepped OFF                                            #
#      - activate when standing next to it and press the ACTION key           #
#                                                                             #
#  To indicate "no triggers" for a Level, leave this file empty (or just      #
#  don't list any "triggers_config" line identifiers within it).              #

#  The dimensions of the Level are found within the Map's config file.        #
