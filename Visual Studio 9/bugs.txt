It's probably a good idea to record bugs in this file. Anyone interested 
in fixing one is welcome to it. This is for bugs in already-implemented
functionality, not things still to be implemented; use Implement_todo.txt
for that.

--Entities are not drawn until they move

Fixed:
--Pressing esc from main menu starts game--should quit
--Options menu doesn't work (clicking that on main has no effect)

--Pressing 'z' on the left or right rectangle (map switches) gives a 
  map/set iterator no incrementable debug assertion. -DF 2009/02/17
  
--App doesn't always seem to start...at least on Windows Server 2008 (Vista)
  The program is indeed in the process chart, but not visible. Is this an
  Allegro bug? -DF 2009/02/17
