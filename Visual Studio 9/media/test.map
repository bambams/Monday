#  When parsing files, spaces surrounding "name", "=", and "value" are ignored.
#  So the following lines are the same (assume '*' is an end-of-line marker):
#         file    =    somefile.txt        *
#  file=somefile.txt*
#
#  Until we come up with a better method, define the width and height of the
#  map, and then name each row with a number.  The parser will find all values
#  that it recognizes, like "file" or "width" and "height", and after those are
#  gone, it will assume numbers "0", "1", ..., "height - 1" are entries.
#
#  I know, it's a hack.  But soon someone will come up with a better solution
#  (like a binary format with a working map editor).
