This file is here so we can add/update things that are NEEDED so we can implement things.

Feel free to change frequently.


Maps:
	Multiple Layers
		# tiles: Need to know height and width of layer (in tiles)
		DRAW_LAYER flag: Some layers may not need to be drawn (like a collision layer)

	Tilemaps
		BITMAP resource of tileset
		Dimensions of the tiles: These SHOULD be 32x32, but I don't want to hard-code those values in unless we really need to
		Tile animation sequences: Need to know which tiles should animate (and the timing)

	Entities
		Current (absolute) position: need to know where they are in x/y coordinates
		From and To tile positions: need to know what tile the Entity is on, and where they are trying to move to


Entities:
	Items
		List of items this Entity is carrying
			Player:  Will have a large list (weapons, armor, etc.)
			NPCs:    May have a few, though they won't be able to drop them
			         *** They MAY be able to give them to the Player, if we wish to implement that feature ***
			Enemies: Will have a smaller list (mostly just their weapon(s), armor, and any special items they can drop)

	Stats
		AP, DP, Agility, etc.

	State
		Entities can be: MOVEMENT_SIT, MOVEMENT_STAND, MOVEMENT_RANDOM, MOVEMENT_SCRIPTED, etc.

	Command Processor
		Depending on the State, entity movements will be issued "commands"
			MOVE_UP,
			MOVE_TARGET(Target *target),
			ATTACK_LEFT,
			ATTACK_TARGET(Target *target)
