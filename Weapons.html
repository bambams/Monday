<p>This is a list of the major items that affect gameplay that the player receives. The player will get other items like keys, tools, etc. in the course of the game but these are the ones that will require coding for. FYI, any time an item is picked up, the game will put a little window up saying "You got item X" Here's a few tips"! It won't be real fancy like in Zelda; think Metroid's or Cave Story's way of handling it.</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Ion Pistol</span>: You get issues this quickly in the game. It fires energy bullets that will go about 75% of the way across the screen (there's a range limit so the player can't safely clear a room by rubbing their back on a wall and firing blind for an hour). Aiming is done with the mouse; the player can fire 360 degrees in the direction of the cursor. Because of this, the sprite will probably be split into top and bottom half so the player can look and aim in one direction while running in all manner of other direction. A bit complex but nothing special. We'll need special "upper half" sprites for at least 4 weapons anyway ...</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Jet Pack</span>: Second major item acquired; the main acquisition from Dungeon 1. The jet will actually shoot you in the air and peak at about the player's height above the ground before hovering back down to just-above ground level. This "jump" will take about 1 to 1.5 seconds to complete, after which the player can start shooting again while moving and hovering. This gives the ability to travel over holes and electrified floors, and also gives the player an ability to "jump" moving obstacles to an extent. So if a spiked log or something rolled through the player's location, and he's between 0 and 1 seconds into his initial jetpack use, we can assume he "jumped" the log, so it should be simple to code. Fuel will take about 30 seconds to expend at full blast, and about 15 seconds to refill from empty. I'm toying with the idea of some rooms having high-gravity floor tiles that disable the jetpack and force a landing. Also, if you get hit, the jet cancels, so maneuvering over large holes while avoiding airborne obstacles will be fun ...</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Rock Crusher</span>: Picked up between Dungeon 1 and 2. This is a gun of sorts too, but an extremely short range one (3-4 tiles). It also follows the mouse cursor and fires a coloured ripple wave; this would be a nice place for some wavy rainbow effect but whatever gets the job done. The player won't have to pick what frequency the gun needs to fire at; it can be assumed the gun can scan that for itself. Any rock the gun has scanned a frequency for will take damage and crumble; if the player hasn't gotten a frequency for the rock he's shooting at then it's unaffected. This should not require radically different coding than the initial gun.</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Scanner</span>: This is the first time this item has been mentioned, and it's the Dungeon 2 special item. This item has a few uses; firstly, in the mine that is Dungeon 2, if the player enters a room where the lights have failed and he doesn't have this item, he'll make a few comments to the effect that he can't continue, and go back to the previous room. This scanner will also follow the cursor and reveal anything within range that might be hidden, either from lack of lighting or active cloaking. If an enemy is cloaked and the player does not have the scanner equipped, the enemy will skip rendering, and maybe just throw up a few particles when moving or show a muzzle flash when firing or something. If the scanner is equipped, the enemy will be rendered fully if within a few tiles of the main cursor, rendered somewhere between 0 and 100 translucency if within 4 to 5 tiles, and not at all if outside that range (rough numbers). Tiles will follow this rule too in blackened rooms; full black tiles when outside range. This item will also reveal some hidden things in Dungeon 3, the alien city. Like bridges over holes that the jetpack doesn't have the gas to clear, or hidden switches that turn off energy walls. Also, when the player gets hit by something invisible, a little "What the hell?" should pop up over his head or something. Just to hint at the player "Hey numbskull! You should be equipping something here ..."</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Ion Launcher</span>: Ooooh, a new weapon from Dungeon 3! Basically energy grenades that will land where the player throws them (possibly also with a range limit). This item will hit distant targets that are behind barriers the gun can't hit, like low walls. It will also hit enemies with armor on the outside that blocks shots, but have vulnerable inner cores. The grenade will not fire if the player picks an area outside of line of sight; the gun will fire anyway, and just hit what it hits. But the game needs to do constant line-of-sight checks when the cursor moves and the grenades are equipped; if the player is trying to throw around a corner, the cursor turns to an X or something. If the player is aiming at a spot behind an energy field or low wall, he can still throw there even if he can't walk or shoot to that location. So some tiles will be walkable/shootable/throwable, some will only be throwable, and some will be neither. The grenade explodes on impact if it hits a target it can affect, and acts as a land mine for 2 seconds after it lands, exploding if nothing has run over it. That way the timing is not so crucial. :)</p>

<p>At this point we're entering Dungeon 4. The action heats up here, and from the small colony traveling to the capital ship and traveling through it, the cinema scene conversations are short and plentiful. Part of this is we get an engineer to remove our weapon safeties and we grab a new toy. Three weapons are affected:</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Jet Pack</span>: No fuel limit anymore. Timed "jumps" will still matter, but you can hover endlessly now. You also move a little quicker.</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Ion Launcher</span>: The grenades will look bigger, and land with a small AOE (say, two tiles wide). More importantly, the shockwave is considered a minor EMP now. This weapon will now be used to take out an enemy's shield before shooting him, plus we can disable any major energy barriers (switches are for punks anyway).</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Scanner</span>: This now passively lights up the room. As long as it is equipped, everything hidden is fully revealed. No more reliance on the cursor.</p>

<p>No gun upgrade, because now we get ...</p>

<p><span class="weaponName">Ion Cannon</span>: Now we're talking! More damage, more range. The downside is you move slower while firing it, Not much, but quite a bit if the direction you're firing and the direction you're moving are more than 90 degrees apart, and maybe give it a slight recoil. Hey, it's big and clumsy, okay? The gun doesn't have this downside.</p>

<p>There's some interesting combinations here. You find an energy door, no switch. Find the switch with the scanner! Oh, it's on the other side of the door? Ion Launcher hits it, door opens. Or you fight a hardened enemy that keeps throwing up a shield after you get your safeties removed. You'll be constantly switching between gun and grenades to wear it down. Some giant worm is burrowing underground and erupting out of the ground to harass you? Scanner find him, rock crusher disturbs the earth enough to force him out. Hover over electrified floors while returning fire. You get the idea. The current design allows no more than two weapons equipped at once so this will have to be kept in mind.</p>
